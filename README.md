1. In the code editor, there is a string called story. We want to gather some information about the individual words and sentences in the string.<br>
   Letâ€™s split the string into individual words and save them in a new array called storyWords.

2. Log how many words there are in this story to the console.

3. There is an array of words that are unnecessary.<br>
   Iterate over your array to filter out these words.<br>
   Save the remaining words in an array called betterWords. 
   

4. There is an array of words called overusedWords.<br>
   These are words overused in this story.<br>
   You want to let the user of your program know how many times they have used these overused words.
   
5. Now, count how many sentences are in the paragraph.<br>
   This may seem tricky, but remember that all of the sentences in this paragraph end with a period (.) or an exclamation mark (!).<br>
   You could iterate over the array and add 1 to a sentence counter variable for each word that has a period or exclamation mark as its final character.

6. Log these items to the console:

   The word count<br>
   The sentence count<br>
   The number of times each overused word appears<br>

   You could choose to simply log them one by one or, for a challenge, create a function that logs all of them with some formatting.

7. Now, log the betterWords array to the console as a single string.
